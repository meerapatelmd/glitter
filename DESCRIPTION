Version: 1.6.4
Authors@R:

           family = "Patel, MD",

Description: Perform basic Git commands such as add, commit, and push directly from
    the R console. A file recovery feature enables easy retrieval of a previously 
    deleted file directly from the R console. For package deployment, helper functions allow for 
    a concurrent deployment of both a new package release to a GitHub repository 
    and an updated pkgdown GitHub Page.
