This package contains convenience functions to
perform basic Git commands such as add, commit, and push directly from
the R console. A file recovery feature enables easy retrieval of a previously 
deleted file directly from the R console. For package deployment, helper functions 
allow for a concurrent deployment of both a new package release to a GitHub 
repository and an updated pkgdown GitHub Page.
